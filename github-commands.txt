# GitHub Push Commands

# 1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
#    - Go to https://github.com
#    - Click "New repository"
#    - Name: octaiq-internship-portal
#    - Make it public or private
#    - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

# 2. Then run these commands in terminal:

cd /Users/mymacbook/Desktop/OctaIQ-portal

# Add your GitHub repository URL (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/octaiq-internship-portal.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
